# Go of the Week: Point of Symmetry

When right and left have the same shape, there is a play in the center. 

​																															-- Old proverb in Go

Go board is a symmetric board. Hence, it's not uncommon to see symmetry shapes in Go. When a symmetric shape appears in Go, the point of the symmetry has the potential to be a really good move. The proverb relates in many ways to the idea of [miai](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Miai). (A move with double purpose). [1] Playing at the symmetry sometimes creates two good sweet points, so if the opponent plays one, you can play the other.
